##Microstate EEGlab toolbox

Extention for EEGlab, enabling microstate analysis in Matlab. Includes full GUI support and ability to run from command window. 

The toolbox includes ability to run microstate analysis on both ERP and spontaneous (e.g. resting state) EEG, using the following clustering algorithms:
* K-means.
* Modified K-means.
* Atomize and Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering (AAHC)
* Topographic Atomize and Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering (TAAHC)
* Variational Microstates

See our guide (or code documentation) for the full description of the toolbox as well as an introduction to the methods in microstate analysis.
